SimpleTube
=========================
Description
-------------------
This is a recreation of Youtube that allows the basic tasks of video streaming such as uploading, commenting and accounts. The front-end is built with HTML/CSS/Javascript with the Bootstrap framework and the back-end uses the JQuery library and PHP, with data stored in a MySQL server. The application also uses a session plugin from https://github.com/AlexChittock/JQuery-Session-Plugin to make session handling easier.
